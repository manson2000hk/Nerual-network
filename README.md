# Nerual-network
Coding a neural network for training a set of data with any layers and number of neural, and backward propagation of the loss back to each layer to updating the weight and bias. (No activation function, linear regression only).
Input the layer number and nerual number of each layer at the beginning.
Use numpy and math library to constuct the code. 
Testing for any layer and neural
Studay the training errror and testing error by adjusting learing rate, number of layer and neural
